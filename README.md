# git-cheatsheet

This Document is for My DevOps Class ,  I want to answer the exercise number 5.
1-Programming projects usually have multiple developers working in parallel. So a version control system like Git is needed to ensure there are no code conflicts 
between the Code developed by multiple developer. in addition we have timline fo project and we can revert to an older version of the code.

2- in version control sstem is a data structure stores files , source codes , directories and meta data . a good repositor has 3 files : READEME.md , LICENSE , .gitinore.

3- in readme file we introduce the project , show how to use and how to contribute it.

4- git clone command is used to point to an existing repository and make a copy of that repository in local repository.

5- we use "git pull" command to update local repository and sync it with remote repo. 

6-reset: git reset is a command that is used to undo local changes to the state of a Git repo and creates a new commit 
  checkout: git checkout is used to switching between different versions of a target entity , such as another branch or another commit.
  revert:git revert is used to create new commit to reverse the effect of some earlier commits.
  
  
7- merge : git merge the codes in multiple branch and creates new commit.in another word combines some commits into one unified history of commits.
   rebase : git rebase integrate changes from one branch into another .rebase moves a feature branch into a master but does not create new commit.
  
8-git log

9- diff command

10- tag is used for a marked version release.

11- 1) create feature branch and then merge with master
    2) create organization , fork from it b teams and then merge by project manager to master branch.
    
12- git branches are a pointer to a snapshot of changes , we can merge it with master.
